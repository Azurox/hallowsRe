## Project goal

This project doesn't aim to be a fully RPG at all, it's just used to train about realtime connection with socket.io
and Unity's software.
My goal is to come up with good solution about the architecture, algorithmic problems and project management by myself.

## Requirement to launch :

- Unity 5.x +
- NodeJs

## Project structure :

- "game" is the unity project
- "server" is the nodejs project

## Project management :

I work alone and I use a Trello board with 2 backlogs :

1. Feature Backlog :
   Every card are feature, they have a checklist named "Dev" that could translate to really short UserStory or task to do and they have also an Acceptance test checklist.

2. Technical Backlog :
   Card represent things that i should not forget, mostly about dev or project architecture.

To be considered done, a feature has to be fully checked.
